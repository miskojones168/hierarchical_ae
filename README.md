## Modeling Autoencoder Latent Space via Hierarchical Models

This is a course project for the COGS-4210 (Cognitive Modeling) course at RPI. In this project, we use a hierarchical model implemented in PyStan to model latent space of autoencoders. This approach is inspired by the ideas found in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which aims to structure the complicated latent space of autoencoders.
